# TODOS
## bugs and edits
- double check project images, especially fbpeds, they seem blurry in places.
- add 'sketches' category for takehomes and anything too small to be considered a project:
-- gusto takehome table component
-- goog.io tree take home
-- bask dashboard? if you were to finish it
- what about a way to break up images into before and after project summary ie below the fold images
- slideshow or carousel for larger image collections ie dudes ep sleeves
- add audio-only style for youtube embed in dudes ep
- sound-ink promo kit prototype

## larger features
- analytics
- testimonials
- blow the skills section out into a little moment with different tabs and expandable content, filter by domain etc
- design design design
