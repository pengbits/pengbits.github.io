  body:[
    `I had the good fortune of managing Dave for many years at Showtime. Dave has an unusually broad and potent skill set, paired with a deep curiosity, an unyielding drive to learn, and a strong instinct for getting the details right. He also has a delivery mindset that's grounded in speed, efficiency, and building solutions that scale.`,
    `Dave transitioned into an engineering role from the design team, but he quickly became one of the most thoughtful and capable engineers on my team. His design background proved especially valuable, allowing him to fill unique gaps, such as his ability to work closely with the creative team to champion design systems and help build premium user experiences faster and more consistently.`,
    `Dave's engineering chops are also top-notch. He's a huge asset as an individual contributor and is also well suited to leadership or peer-support roles. He was a trusted mentor to more junior engineers, regularly supporting them through pair programming, thoughtful code reviews, and by helping establish and uphold high engineering standards across the team.`,
    `Dave is an excellent engineer and a wonderful colleague. He makes any team he's part of better, and I recommend him without hesitation.`
